# Intro to NURBS - Python

Python implementations of algorithms contained in "An Introduction to NURBS With Historical Perspective" by David F Rogers. Python and Numpy are chosen so I can express the math as close to how it's written as possible. Matplotlib is used for visualizing the generated curves and surfaces. I will usually make sure the code works for an example or two so expect bugs if you're using this as a reference. Code is vectorized where convenient/obvious.

Files are named after the concept they implement.
